The colors, the animation, the humor, the soundtrack; everything about it was damn near perfect and I enjoyed myself to the fullest from beginning to end. The only bad thing about it is that it ended."

It's been a while since I felt that way with something new. But my expectations were high going in and I still thought so 30 minutes in. Then an hour in. Then 2 hours in. Then it ended with a David Byrne and Mitski song over the credits. C'mon now."
